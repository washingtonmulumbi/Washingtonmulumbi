  <h3>Key Verse: Habakkuk 3:16-19</h3>
  <h4>Opening song: 483 “I Need Thee Every Hour” (Seventh-day Adventist 
Hymnal)

Adventist Hymnal)</h4>
  <p1 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">We have lived a long time in an era of much uncertainty, and the events 
causing this uncertainty are increasing, leading to crises without precedent. 
Some of these events include the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences, 
wars and their consequences, disasters, unfairness, terror, violence, etc. Each 
country around the world is going through difficult moments. Society is in 
crisis—morally and financially as well as with identity. We are going through 
a time similar to the day when Jesus, seeing the mass of people, “was moved
with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
sheep having no shepherd” (Matthew 9:36).
The result of all this leads to fright and uncertainty. But being frightened 
and having uncertainty is not a problem itself because fright is part of a human 
being. Fright appeared to the world when Adam, the first man, decided to 
disobey to God. Then for the first time, the human being was frightened</p1>
  <p2 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">(Genesis 3:10). Fright has its fair side because it proves to what degree we are 
limited and weak. Uncertainty determines that we have no control over 
anything. But both fright and uncertainty will bear fruits if only they are 
accompanied with hope.
So, in view of this local and universal uproar, what’s left to be done? How 
do we live one day after another with such bad news of this kind? How should 
we strengthen our soul so that despair does not crush us? How should we 
hearten others to continue living even during these terrible times? Let’s learn 
from Habakkuk’s experience:
“When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: 
rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I 
might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, 
he will invade them with his troops. Although the fig tree shall not 
blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall
fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from 
the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; Yet I will rejoice in 
the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation. The LORD God is my 
strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make 
me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed 
instruments” (Habakkuk 3:16-19).
Background
Let’s go back to see what happened. What is Habakkuk going to tell us 
and teach us in how to overcome fright and uncertainty by filling us with hope 
and confidence, even if we do not see any apparent or immediate change.
First, who was the man called Habakkuk? By reading his book, we 
notice that he was not a man focused on himself, on his own comfort and 
security. He was deeply anxious for the natural, spiritual, and moral condition</p2>
  <p3 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">of his compatriots. He loved his nation and his people, but he knew that if 
they continued to break God’s laws, they would continue to draw closer to a 
precipice.
We do not know much about the prophet. His name may means “the 
one who constrains” or “the one who fights”. Many prefer “the one who 
constrains”. He constrains his people and embraces them. He comforts his 
people and gives them courage, like we embrace a crying child, to make sure 
that if this is the way of God, all will get better very soon.
Habakkuk was addressing the nation of Judah; it was a difficult and dark 
period. A time when morality, impressed by idolatry, was almost nonexistent. 
There was widespread injustice. Two questions were close to his lips: Till 
when and why? If Habakkuk were here today, he may say the same thing. 
We can ask the question on his behalf: Until when, Lord, and why? The 
book of Habakkuk appears in the form of a dialog between God and the 
prophet. Habakkuk was perplexed with current affairs and what is going to 
happen, such as the Babylonian invasion.</p3>

    <ol style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 22px;color: black"> Development</ol>
  </ul>
  <p4 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">During times of fright and uncertainty, how do we not to lose hope? Let’s 
first look at what hope means. It is waiting with trust. It is a waiting whose 
origin is belief in God’s promises and above all, belief in God’s person 
Himself. I trust in God, so I hope in peace. In this study, we will speak about 
these essential elements so that we will no</p4>
  <ul>
    <li style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">The first thing to do if we don’t want to lose hope is to 
speak to Go</li>
  </ul>
  <p5 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Yes, speak to Him, in other words, pray. It is quite obvious. One can 
even say that it is too simple. But that is exactly what the prophet did. He 
spoke to God; he discussed with God. The prophet opened his heart and 
sincerely spoke to God. And not only did Habakkuk speak to God, but he also 
listened to. Let’s see, for instance, how Habakkuk addressed God in the 
following text:</p5> 
  <h4 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: black">“O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even 
cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! Why dost thou 
shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling 
and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and 
contention. Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never 
go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; 
therefore wrong judgement proceedeth” (Habakkuk1:2-4).</h4> 
  <p6 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Habakkuk expressed to God his anxiety as if God where his friend. If 
we go through the Bible, we’ll see people in times of crisis, and the first thing 
they did was to speak to God. King David fasted and prayed so that the son he 
had with Bathsheba did not die. Daniel, because of the king’s edict on the 
lion’s den, was found in his prayer room. In Mark 14, when Jesus was at 
Gethsemane, He was anxious and prays to the Father because of the cup that 
He was about to drink. And in verse 38, Jesus told Peter:</p6>
  <h4 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: black">“Watch ye and 
    pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh,is weak"
 </h4> 
  <p7 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">The temptation is losing hope. The temptation is being lied to by 
circumstances. Thus, it is in prayers that our spirit is strengthened. It is in prayers that our spiritual eyes are opened. In short, so as not to lose hope, we 
should establish a prayer life that involves a strong desire to be with God.
What are the advantages in that? To His close friends, God reveals His 
secrets (Psalms 25:14). Those who seek Him will find Him, according to
Jeremiah 29:13).</p7> 
  <ul>
    <ol style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 22px;color: black">What does God reveal to Habakkuk in His conversation with him 
through prayer? </ol>
  </ul>
  <p8 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">To answer Habakkuk’s first complaint, the one concerning knowing
how much time evil will prevail (Habakkuk 1:2-3), God assured that He 
would exercise His judgement through the Babylonians (Habakkuk 1:6).
To answer Habakkuk’s second complaint, the one about why God chose 
the Babylonians to punish Judah (Habakkuk 1:13-2:1), God assured that He 
knew the Babylonians’ sins and that He would also punish them when their 
turn came, but as for the righteous one, by his faithfulness he will keep living 
in God (Habakkuk 2 :4).
That is the way to resuscitate Habakkuk’s hope, just like God will do 
for us when we cross into uncertainty. In comparison with our anxiety, God 
tells Habakkuk the following: 
“…Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that 
readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it 
shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely 
come, it will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright 
in him: but the just shall live by his faith” (Habakkuk 2 :2-4).
Paul cites parts of this verse in Romans 1:17 and Galatians 3:13 and in 
Hebrews 10:38, just before his famous chapter on faith. It is a particularly
useful affirmation to the Christians when they experience difficult moments,all according to His will.
It is common that there are difficult moments even when we pray, but 
God will be glorified because He gave us the Holy Spirit. According to 
Romans 8:26, Paul says that when we do not know what to say, the Holy 
Spirit expresses what is in our hearts. That is when the Holy Spirit helps us 
and shares our supplication with the heavens. Our Father gives us means to go 
directly to Him. Can you see how good He is?
How is your prayer life? Do you really use that weapon for your own
spiritual support?</p8>
  <ul>
    <lo style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 22px;color: black">The second thing to do if we don’t want to lose hope is
to take a realistic view of the situation.</lo>
  </ul>
  <p9 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Although the prophet learned from God that invaders will be judged, he 
was yet in distress. He was in despair; his legs shook but he decided not to 
move. He decided to wait silently which means he had a rest. The prophet 
knew what was going to happen. He had a vision</p9>
  <h4>“When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: 
rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I 
might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the 
people, he will invade them with his troops” (Habakkuk 3:16).</h4>
  <p10 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Habakkuk gave a deep declaration in view of imminent tribulations 
which were coming to the Judah nation. In verses 17 - 19 of chapter 3, it is 
said: Whatever comes up, I will put my trust in God, my Force.
Verse 17 proves that Habakkuk understands that the country will be 
destroyed by Babylonians. All will be taken away from the people who decided to turn away from the Lord. So, we can conclude that this situation is 
just, that they were worthy of going through temptations. As they sowed, so 
should they reap (Galatians 6:7).
But we can now ask a question: If I did not sow disobedience, why then 
does the fig tree not bloom with flowers, why does the fruit not come, why 
does this work not appear? Why does it not happen?
Do we find anywhere in the Bible where Jesus promises only glory and 
peaceful days? You cannot find it. But He has been very honest by saying that 
in this world we will have tribulation (John 16:33). So, in order not to lose 
hope, we should understand that everybody undergoes tribulations. Like the 
apostle Paul said to the Philippians “For unto you it is given in the behalf of 
Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake” (Philippians
1:29).</p10>
  <h4>There are many reasons why tribulations strike us:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Some sins have been committed but not confessed or abandoned.</li>
    <li>Bad choices we have made, by acting without discretion or with lack of 
        patience.</li>
    <li>The world around us is under the aegis of evil’s power (1 John 5:19).</li>
    <li>God’s permission to achieve the great and endless aim (Job 1:12).</li>
  </ul>
  <p11 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">In short, to have a realistic vision of life helps us not to lose hope. And 
finally, after understanding what would happen, something inevitable, 
Habakkuk ended his prayer by turning his eyes towards Who is really 
important.</p11>
  <ul style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 22px;color: black">The third thing to do if we don’t want to lose hope is
to have a clear vision of God.</ul>
  <p12 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">We still need to contextualize verse 17 of Habakkuk chapter 3 so that 
the rest have a sense for today. The Prophet mentions: the fig tree, wine, olive 
tree, wheat, sheep, cattle. It is all he needed to live. Having what’s recorded in 
verse 17 would have been similar to the following: Even if there is no food on 
the table and if there is no stick on the shelf, the wine producers would charge 
for branches, the internet connection would disappear … I extrapolate of 
course.
Think about something without which you could not live, something 
really important and vital to you. That is what the prophet speaks about. Even 
if things don’t go the way you wished. Even if all seems strange. Even if there 
is no response. Even if you do not understand why this or that. Even if there is 
insecurity. Even if bereavement takes you aback! Then Habakkuk says in 
verse 18: </p12>
  <h4>“Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my 
salvation.”</h4>
  <p13 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Even within his trouble (v. 16), Habakkuk expresses his trust in the 
LORD (v. 18); he is fed and fortified with divine answers. When you don’t 
have a clear vision of God or if you lose sight of who God is, tribulation 
will push you more and more to the brink of collapse. And the 
consequence is despondency.
In Ephesians 1:3, it is said that God the Father “ blessed us with all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.” In Romans 5:8, it is said that 
“God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, 
Christ died for us.” Habakkuk chose to rejoice in God who rose from His
throne of glory and fell to our level. He came and sought us. He opened the 
way of freedom. The source of our joy is in the God of our salvation.
As Jeremiah says: “This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. It is 
the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness” (Lamentations 
3:21-23).
The God of my salvation means the God who loves me, the God of my 
victory, the Victorious God. The One who delivered the people from Egypt 
with His powerful hand. The one who delivered us from death and sin’s 
clutches with the help of the powerful blood of Jesus. Remember that Jesus 
died for us. Remember also that Jesus was raised from the dead. He is our 
God, Hallalujah!
Even if something is missing, I want to be in a joyful mood, because the 
Lord is my God. Moreover, the Lord fortifies my encouragement and joy. 
Again, the prophet says: </p13>
  <h4>“The LORD God is my strength, and he will make 
my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high 
places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments” (Habakkuk 3:19).</h4>
  <p14 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">The conviction comes from the One who can tackle all, like David 
tackled Goliath. As David himself said:</p14>
  <h4>“The Lord is my light and my 
salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom 
shall I be afraid?” (Psalms 27:1).</h4>
  <p14 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">The LORD will make us run fast; He will 
make us go higher than we can imagine.
So, to not lose hope and to continue rejoicing, have a clear vision of
God. Have a true knowledge of and a profound friendship with Him. God 
the Creator, Savior and Father.</p14>
  <ul style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 22px;color: black">conclusion</ul>
  <p15 style="font-family: times new roman;font-size: 15px;color: white">Habakkuk’s experience is a demonstration of faith and perfect joy in the 
worst circumstances. What a victory he had in his soul! Habakkuk’s experience is a demonstration of faith and perfect joy in the 
worst circumstances. What a victory he had in his soul!</p15>
